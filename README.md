# Predicting Patient Mortalilty
## Method
In this project, I predict the probability of death of a patient that is entering an ICU (Intensive Care Unit). I am using K-Nearest Neighbor models and Support Vector Machines.

## Data
The dataset comes from MIMIC project (https://mimic.physionet.org/). MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.
